# a magnetic field (b_vec) and a frequency (f_vec)

# processes should stop (like batterycheckers, or temperature
# monitors)
qt.mstart()

# Next a new data object is made.
# The file will be placed in the folder:
# <datadir>/<datestamp>/<timestamp>_testmeasurement/
# and will be called:
# <timestamp>_testmeasurement.dat
# to find out what 'datadir' is set to, type: qt.config.get('datadir')
data = qt.Data(name='piezo_sweep')

# Now you provide the information of what data will be saved in the
# datafile. A distinction is made between 'coordinates', and 'values'.
# Coordinates are the parameters that you sweep, values are the
# parameters that you readout (the result of an experiment). This
# information is used later for plotting purposes.
# Adding coordinate and value info is optional, but recommended.
# If you don't supply it, the data class will guess your data format.
data.add_coordinate('piezo voltage')

# The next command will actually create the dirs and files, based
# on the information provided above. Additionally a settingsfile
# is created containing the current settings of all the instruments.
data.create_file()

# Next two plot-objects are created. First argument is the data object
# that needs to be plotted. To prevent new windows from popping up each
# measurement a 'name' can be provided so that window can be reused.
# If the 'name' doesn't already exists, a new window with that name
# will be created. For 3d plots, a plotting style is set.

# preparation is done, now start the measurement.
# It is actually a simple loop.
